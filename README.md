## RSAlgorithms

Recently, we have launched an open source project [**RSAlgorithms**](https://github.com/hongleizhang/RSAlgorithms), which provides an integrated training and testing framework. In this framework, we implement a set of classical **traditional recommendation methods** which make predictions only using rating data and **social recommendation methods** which utilize trust/social information in order to alleviate the sparsity of ratings data. Besides, we have collected some classical methods implemented by others for your convenience.
